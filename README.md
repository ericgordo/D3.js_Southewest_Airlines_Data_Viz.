# D3 Data Visualization
## by Eric Gordon
This Project is my first attempt at using D3 to create a data Visualization! I had fun learning about the D3.js library, and I look forward to using it again in the future.

### Summary
This project utilizes an old dataset to show how many more flights Southwest operated annually compared to other major U.S. airlines. I tried to make the graph as simple as possible, because I think the data shows the story itself!
